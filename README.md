# My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/events) solutions

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/hckr/adventofcode/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/hckr/adventofcode)

## How to run

All programs read from the standard input (`stdin`), e.g.:
```bash
$ ./1.py < ../1.in
```

## Suggestions?

If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to create an issue. The code isn't either most optimal, nor in the best style. I don't know all of used languages well â€“ I treat Advent of Code as a possibility to try and learn something new and have fun :)
